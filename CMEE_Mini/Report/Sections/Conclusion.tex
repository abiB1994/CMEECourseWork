Overall the results obtained from this study support findings previously made in
the field of thermal ecology; this study highlights the impact of temperature on several
vital biological processes, and the potential impact of acclimatization on these traits. With
the global temperature set to increase, it is vital to understand the implications that
this will have on our ecosystems and the species within them.

Further research into phenotypic flexibility and it's potential impacts on both heat tolerance 
and biological traits, could yield insightful and valuable results into how species will
cope with the ever changing temperatures.
