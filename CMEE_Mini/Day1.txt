# Mini Projects

Can simulate data! - Fit it to 2 models, pick the better fit 

- Model selection : Several competing hypotheses are fitted to
data + compared statistical theory

- Null + alternative

mechanistic models aim explain PROCESSES underlying observed patterns
- The philosophy of physics

Empirical or phenomenological models show relationships between data, but
provides no insight into why related.

Linear Models:
-when you call lm, it is doing a matrix algebra - division, times etc!
Linear models can have x expontents, but coefficients and y cannot be squared.

Non Linear Least Squares
- Start with init. val
- Generate curve by the initial vals
- Calc. residual sum-of-squares (rss)
- Adjust the param. to make curve come closer to points. - lmfit in R
- Rinse + repeat
- Python more robust

In statistics, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz criterion
 (also SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; 
 the model with the lowest BIC is preferred. It is based, in part, on the 
 likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
