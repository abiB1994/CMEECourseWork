	\maketitle
	Is the temperature of one year significantly correlated with the next year (successive years), across the years?
	
	\begin{abstract}
		The aim of this assignment was to see if the temperatures collected
		at Key West in Florida were significantly correlated with the next year.

	\section{Interpretation}
	Figure 1 shows a graph with a significantly positive correlation between t and t-1 years. The positive correlation shown in the graph is further backed up by a pearsons correlation value of 0.33, which was attained by computing t$(x_time)$ and t-1$(y_time)$ years using the $cor()$ function in R, and a p value of $~ 0.003$ indicating these results are extremely unlikely to arise by chance. Hence, it can be interpreted that one years temperature is indicative of the subsequent years temperature.
