Ecological Neutral Theory

Neutral thoery- one tool in toolbox
- Individuals are ecologically equivilant - Neutral
But neutral != null model

Neutral Models assume species are the same - not so - it assumes
INDIVIDUALS are the same.

Demographic properties are independant of species identity

Does NOT mean that species are interchangable - if groups are not the same
try a diff model

Eventually everything becomes the same

INTRO TO HPC

Embarassingly parallel problems
-Graphics - i.e. graphics cards
-Simulations with multi params.

Non embarrassingly parallel probs.
-Fluid dynamics
-Multi tasks run by single program

Parallelize code:
i = as.numeric(Sys.getenv("PBS_ARRAY_INDEX"))

do_simulation(i)

used in code to give a simulation number

sudo random - if you set seed and ask for a random number, you will
get the same "random" number

running in parallel requires taking control of "random seeds"

Each simulation requires a diff seed i.e. sim 1 seed 1 etc.

save results in ram then write to the disk at the end

Output your code in series of files
i.e. output1.rda
output2.rda
etc

Write local code to read in rda(r data) outputs 

Experimenting with a parameter also:

using if statement or %% :

Test code locally to know your memory and time requirements - important!
Never see HPC, when you request use of it, only get a set amount of time
so if code overruns, you don't get any outcome! Type top to see how much ram
is being used in terminal?

Build a timer into your code!


#set random seed as i
# select sim. param. 
#do sim
#save output ..i...
#inc. timer

HPC at Imperial :
cx1
Cluster of many ordinary computers

cx2
Massively parallel system

ax1
Even bigger and better!


$HOME - 10Gb

$WORK - 150Gb - but not backed up

$TMPDIR - Largely ignore - work disappears in here!

You have to collect them back from TMPDIR to WORK and WORK to HOME.

Need to write in your shell script

Use sftp:

sftp 





ssh -l username login.cx1.hpc.ic.ac.uk
ls #lists the files in $HOME

mkdir foldername


#PBS -l walltime=12:00:00    <- tells the machine how long this code needs to run
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=800mb  <- how much memory code needs

R --vanilla < PATH/TO/FILE

mv datafile* $WORK <- allows for alternate ending i.e. file1, 2


Day 3 lecture

Neutral Theory model - 

- Speciation and death
- Dynamic Equilirium - Species constantly changing - constant state of flux
						- But still balance between in and out
						
						-Speciation - Species change
						
Some individuals don't survive to the present day - not worth monitoring 
Dont need to remember phylogeny, where new species came from

- Coalescence
-Turns everything upside down
- Uncover everything that we know for all individuals

- Sam Thompson - Simulation of every tree in Panamar watershed area
				-Using Coalescence
				- Using neutral theory to predict the present situation

Fractals in nature

Complex numbers:
-i = sqrt(negative no.)


x= a + ib

Mandelbrot set - funny images!
Z -> Z^2 + C

C is given by position on the complex plane
Get sequence of nos out - if it flys off to infinity - outside mandelbrot set

Start with z = 0


Also Julia sets

Z <- Z^2 + C 
C is constant


What is a fractal

Lines ,flat squares, Cubes - NOT FRACTAL

Fractal has a dimension that is not a whole number - Convoluted!
They are also self similar

Koch curve

Look at the slides

Measuring dimension of costline

Fractal behaviour in biology may only work at certain (probably intermediate)
scales

All equations are on slides


Area of a fern - box counting algorithm

For almost 2d 
Log length of sqaure (x)
(y) no of squares to cover object

Fractal dimension D = -1 * grad. 
will give fractal dimension




Hausdorff dimension

Why do fractals appear in nature:
Biol.
-Simple set of rules (DNA)
-Fractal structures are heritable
-Need to max surface area, min vol

Geograph.
-Same processes at multi scales


Also in landscape eco
anim behav
chaos


Gaussian + Fat Tailed dispersal
- on lecture slides

All on log scales:
Fat tailed dispersal allows for longer and further travel - wind dispersal

Fat tailed dispersal - leads to power law for species rich by area for longer

Animal behaviour
Fat tailed dispersal
-Optimum search strategy without local knowledge

chaos

Tiniest change makes a big diff to outcome much later on
Logistic function:
Describing rate of change
Logistic map:
Showing next discrete value

Fractals display self similarity
Deterministic chaos is present in systems where a small change in the
initial conditions dramatically changes the outcome
