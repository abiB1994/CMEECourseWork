Remote sensing

Mapping landscapes manually

Pros
-V. fine detail

Cons
-Expensive
-Slow
-Inconsistent


Remote sensors:
	Passive - senses solar radiation, reflected light
		-Albedo: proporation of radiation reflected from a surface
		-Vantablack ~ 0 Albedo
		NB:Texture + angle strongly affect albedo
		
	
	Active - emits and senses reflections
	-Lidar
	
Reflectance:
	The world looks different when 'shotting' diff. wavelengths at it

Remote sensing is hard: seperating colours in pictures to get a reflectance 'profile'

HEO = High Earth Orbit - Low resolution
LEO = Low Earth Orbit - High res


NIR = Near Infrared Radiation
