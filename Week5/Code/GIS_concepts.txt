GIS Concepts

Geographic Info = [Creating, Storing, Manipulating, Analysing, Presenting] 
GIS = Fancy form of database

GI - [A set of co-ord, a known co-ord syst] BOTH bits required

Lattitude - An angle above or below equat. Points of equal latitude form a parallel
			Distance between parallels is constant. +/- 90 degrees

Longitude - An angle around the equator, Points of equal form a meridian,
			Distance between meridians vary - North and South pole Longs. meet
			+/- 360 degrees


Geo. Co-ord Syst (GCS) = Earth is not a sphere! ~1 in 298 flattening Affects data collection 
					and understanding

Datums - WGS 1984 - Datums are co-ordinate systems - Telling us what shape
		the earth is, essential so that co-ords are correct + recreatable

Datums are interchangeable with GCS 

Geoid - Surface of equal gravitational force, lat + long set from centre of earths mass
		0.0 in dif location when using gravity


WGS 1984 - Combined Datum + Geoid, Used by GPS, Off Greenwich by a little due to going
			through centre of mass
			
Countries adopt local datum models that fit better locally

British grid - OSGB 36 datum

Datum shift - shift in lat/long values when changing datum

Spherical Geometry - Ellipsoidal Geometry
