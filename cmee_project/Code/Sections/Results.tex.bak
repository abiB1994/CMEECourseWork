It was noted prior to training that a dataset containing 8 classes can only achieve an average accuracy of 12.5\% if randomly guessing. Human expert accuracies could not be reliably obtained as all individuals were involved in the data collection, but it is estimated that a 75\% accuracy rating could be concluded.
Table 2 shows all accuracy outputs obtained from all models; even the lowest training accuracy (CNN trained on Dataset 3 - RGB images and all colour-pass filtered images, learning rate 0.15 - 88.3\%) supersedes both of the aforementioned accuracies, showing strong promise for the use of deep learning in future classification problems.

Testing accuracies were obtained by using the final models to predict the classes of unseen data (42 multi-stress images, 209 duration infection images). Testing accuracies were lower than training accuracies, but still exceeded that of random chance and human accuracy.

Increasing the number of trees in the RF model proved computationally more expensive, with final accuracies only slightly differing from the original outcomes (Table 2). Lowering the learning rate of the CNN proved worthwhile; testing/ validation accuracy increased 5\%, with the risk of over-fitting also being minimised.

Table 2 shows that both RF and CNN models produced very similar results; when True Positive accuracy ratings were compared between RF and CNN models, CNN come out on top (Figure 6).

The pixel intensities gathered from the RGB images in the multi-stress and infection duration dataset show that the models were classifying correctly; all treatments were significantly different, thus allowing for further support for deep learning methods in future studies. 

\subsection*{Multi-stress treatments}

We wanted to test the ability of both CNNs and RFs to classify multi-stress images; all models were built and trained on the same set of multi-stress images, and tested on a seperate set of images. The four versions of the multi-stress image dataset (1 - RGB, 2 - RGB and two colour filters, 3 - RGB and all filters, 3-NORM - normalised dataset 3) show slight variation in performance (Table 2). All training accuracies were \textgreater 90\%, superseding the theoretical random classifier (12.5\%) and human expert (75\%).


Both RFs and CNNs returned high (\textgreater  88\%) training accuracies for all datasets; training accuracies decreased as datasets contained more colour-pass filter images (Table 2). Despite this, testing/ validation accuracies increased as more colour-pass images were included. 

Models trained on the normalised dataset (Dataset 3-NORM) returned lower accuracies for both testing and training in comparison to Dataset 3 (Table 2).


As both CNN and RF models were returning similar accuracy ratings, the percentage certainties of correct predictions for were compared (Figure 6a). The outcome of this comparison was that the CNN models predictions were significantly more certain than that of the RFs (ANOVA: $F_{1,50}$ = 218.1 , p \textless 0.0001).

\subsection*{Duration Infection}

To test the ability of both CNNs and RFs in their ability to classify infection duration images, several models were built and trained on the same set of infection duration images, and tested on a seperate set of images. The infection duration dataset (dataset 4) was correctly (\textgreater 85\%) classified by both models; both testing and training accuracies were \textgreater 90\%, far greater than random chance and human accuracies.

Both RF and CNNs managed to return a \textgreater 97\% training accuracy and a 94\% testing accuracy (Table 1); when true positive prediction certainties were compared (Figure 6b), CNNs were found to be significantly more certain in comparison to the RF model (ANOVA: $F_{1,120}$ = 216.3, p \textless 0.0001).

\end{figure}
\subsection*{Pixel Intensities}

Pixel intensities were extracted from dataset 1 (multi-stress, RGB only) and dataset 4 (infection-duration, RGB) images. These were extracted by masking the images, as shown in Figure 6, and extracting pixel intensity values for the RGB channels. Pixel intensities for both multi-stress and infection duration treatments show that all treatments are statistically different from one another, allowing for further support of the models classification results.

  \label{fig:sub2}
\end{figure}

When pixel intensities were compared between treatments, both multi-stress and duration infection treatments returned significant results (ANOVA multi-stress:  $F_{7,4646161}$ = 38676, p \textless 0.0001; ANOVA duration infection:  $F_{2,1628925}$ = 32894,  p \textless 0.0001); Figures 7 and 8 show that all treatment types were significantly different from one another. Further comparison shows that channels significantly differ both within and between treatments (ANOVA duration infection: Appendix Figure 1, $F_{8,1628919}$ = 3437540,  p \textless 0.0001; ANOVA multi-stress: Appendix Figure 2, $F_{23,4646145}$ = 17195, p \textless 0.0001).
