Summary
The metabolic theory of ecology ({MTE}) as applied to the plant sciences aims to provide a general synthesis for the structure and functioning of plants from organelles to ecosystems. {MTE} builds from simple assumptions of individual metabolism to make predictions about phenomena across a wide range of scales, from individual plant structure and function to community dynamics and global nutrient cycles. The scope of its predictions include morphological allometry, biomass partitioning, vascular network design, and life history phenomena at the individual level; size-frequency distributions, population growth rates, and energetic equivalence at the community level; and the flux, turnover and storage of nutrients at the ecosystem level. Here, we provide an overview of {MTE}, by considering its assumptions and predictions at these different levels of organization and explaining how the model integrates phenomena among all of these scales. We highlight the model’s many successes in predicting novel patterns and draw attention to areas in which gaps remain between observations and {MTE}’s assumptions and predictions. Considering the theory as a whole, we argue that {MTE} has made a significant contribution in furthering our understanding of those unifying aspects of the structure and function of plants, populations, communities, and ecosystems.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

A detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in mean seasonal and annual surface air temperature ({SAT}) in the Arctic is presented mainly for the period 1951–2005. Mean seasonal and annual homogenized and complete series of {SAT} from up to 35 Arctic stations were used in the analysis. The focus in this paper is on the 11 years 1995–2005, a period which saw dramatic warming in the Arctic ({\textgreater}1˚C for annual values in relation to the 1951–90 mean). An abrupt rise in {SAT} occurred in the mid-1990s and was most pronounced in autumn and winter ({\textgreater}2˚C). The greatest warming in the period 1995–2005 occurred in the Pacific and Canadian regions ({\textgreater}1˚C), while the lowest was in the Siberian region (0.82˚C). This period has been the warmest since at least the 17th century. In particular, 2005 was an exceptionally warm year ({\textgreater}2˚C in relation to the 1951–90 mean) and was warmer than 1938, the warmest year in the 20th century. The seasonal and annual trends of the areally averaged Arctic {SAT} for the periods 1936–2005, 1951–2005 and 1976–2005 are positive, with the exception of winter and autumn for the first period. The majority of trends calculated for the last two periods are statistically significant. While there are varying opinions about the forces driving the present warming, it seems likely that the marked rise in {SAT} in the mid-1990s (mainly from 1994 to 1995) was caused by (i) a set of natural factors, (ii) non-linear effects of greenhouse-gas loading, or (iii) the combined effect of these two groups of factors.},

	abstract = {Bucking the trend
Responses to climate change have been observed across many species. There is a general trend for species to shift their ranges poleward or up in elevation. Not all species, however, can make such shifts, and these species might experience more rapid declines. Kerr et al. looked at data on bumblebees across North America and Europe over the past 110 years. Bumblebees have not shifted northward and are experiencing shrinking distributions in the southern ends of their range. Such failures to shift may be because of their origins in a cooler climate, and suggest an elevated susceptibility to rapid climate change.
Science, this issue p. 177
For many species, geographical ranges are expanding toward the poles in response to climate change, while remaining stable along range edges nearest the equator. Using long-term observations across Europe and North America over 110 years, we tested for climate change–related range shifts in bumblebee species across the full extents of their latitudinal and thermal limits and movements along elevation gradients. We found cross-continentally consistent trends in failures to track warming through time at species’ northern range limits, range losses from southern range limits, and shifts to higher elevations among southern species. These effects are independent of changing land uses or pesticide applications and underscore the need to test for climate impacts at both leading and trailing latitudinal and thermal limits for species.

Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.
A meta-analysis shows that species are shifting their distributions in response to climate change at an accelerating rate.

Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

Recent forecasts for future climates emphasize altered temperature variation and precipitation, but most studies of animals have largely focused on forecasting the outcome of changes in mean temperature. Theory suggests that extreme thermal variation and precipitation will influence species performance and hence affect their response to changes in climate. Using an information-theoretic approach, we show that in squamate ectotherms (mostly lizards and snakes), two fitness-influencing components of performance, the critical thermal maximum and the thermal optimum, are more closely related to temperature variation and to precipitation, respectively, than they are to mean thermal conditions. By contrast, critical thermal minimum is related to mean annual temperature. Our results suggest that temperature variation and precipitation regimes have had a strong influence on the evolution of ectotherm performance, so that forecasts for animal responses to climate change will have to incorporate these factors and not only changes in average temperature.},

Here, we develop a series of predictive models for physiological thermal tolerances in ants based on current and future climates. We found that tropical ants have lower warming tolerances, a metric of susceptibility to climate warming, than temperate ants despite greater increases in temperature at higher latitudes. Using climatic, ecological and phylogenetic data, we refine our predictions of which ants (across all regions) were most susceptible to climate warming. We found that ants occupying warmer and more mesic forested habitats at lower elevations are the most physiologically susceptible to deleterious effects of climate warming. Phylogenetic history was also a strong indicator of physiological susceptibility. In short, we find that ants that live in the canopies of hot, tropical forest are the most at risk, globally, from climate warming. Unfortunately this is where many, perhaps most, ant and other species on Earth live.},

Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species’ ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into {SDMs}. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based {SDMs} can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic {SDMs} have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into {SDMs}, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

	abstract = {Environmental temperature has strong and systematic effects on biological processes at all levels of organization, ranging from cells to ecosystems. The large temporal and spatial variation in Earth's temperature creates a complex thermal landscape within which life evolves and operates. Here, we present a data set on how diverse biological rates and times respond to temperature, which we hope will aid in the search for general mechanisms of thermal dependence. For nearly a century, intraspecific studies (within single species' populations) of thermal responses have been conducted on a wide range of organismal traits. Comparative studies of these data are essential for elucidating mechanisms underlying thermal response curves. However, such comparative intraspecific studies have been limited because of a lack of a comprehensive database that organizes these data with consistent units and trait definitions. Here, we present a database of 2352 thermal responses for 220 traits for microbes, plants, and animals compiled from 270 published sources. This represents the most diverse and comprehensive thermal response data set ever compiled. The traits in this database span levels of biological organization from internal physiology to species interactions and were measured in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats for 411 species. Although we include some physiological rates, most data are for ecological traits, which we define here to mean any organismal trait that directly determines interactions between individuals within or across species. We hope that publication of our data set will encourage others to compile complementary data sets, especially on individual physiology and life history traits. Intraspecific and interspecific (across species' populations) analyses of our data set should provide new insights into generalities and deviations in the thermal dependence of biological traits, and thus how biological systems, from cells to ecosystems, respond to temperature change. Such insights are essential for understanding how natural biological systems function, and how life is responding to Earth's complex and rapidly changing thermal landscape.},

Here, we use examples from our work on common killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) to illustrate some important conceptual issues relating to {TPCs} in the context of using these curves to predict the responses of organisms to climate change. Phenotypic plasticity has the capacity to alter the shape and position of the {TPCs} for acute exposures, but these changes can be obscured when rate processes are measured only following chronic exposures. For example, the acute {TPC} for mitochondrial respiration in killifish is exponential in shape, but this shape changes with acclimation. If respiration rate is measured only at the acclimation temperature, the {TPC} is linear, concealing the underlying mechanistic complexity at an acute time scale. These issues are particularly problematic when attempting to use {TPCs} to predict the responses of organisms to temperature change in natural environments. Many {TPCs} are generated using laboratory exposures to constant temperatures, but temperature fluctuates in the natural environment, and the mechanisms influencing performance at acute and chronic time scales, and the responses of the performance traits at these time scales may be quite different. Unfortunately, our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of organisms to temperature change is incomplete, particularly with respect to integrating from processes occurring at the level of single proteins up to whole-organism functions across different time scales, which is a challenge for the development of strongly grounded mechanistic models of responses to global climate change.},

The focus of much recent attention has been on developmental plasticity – the environmentally induced variability during development within a single genotype. The phenotypic variation expressed by single reproductively mature organisms throughout their life, traditionally the subject of many physiological studies, has remained underexploited in evolutionary biology. Phenotypic flexibility, the reversible within-individual variation, is a function of environmental conditions varying predictably (e.g. with season), or of more stochastic fluctuations in the environment. Here, we provide a common framework to bring the different categories of phenotypic plasticity together, and emphasize perspectives on adaptation that reversible types of plasticity might provide. We argue that better recognition and use of the various levels of phenotypic variation will increase the scope for phenotypic experimentation, comparison and integration.},

	abstract = {The plasticity of behaviour consists of an array of behavioural responses to varying environmental conditions. It is widely predicted that the range of behavioural responses will increase with environmental variability. According to this prediction, the slopes of a response curve representing behavioural plasticity would be identical in environments with different variability. However, the range of behaviours can also increase with the slope of the curve, so that in a given range of environments, the plasticity of behaviour would vary. For example, where two environments are similar in terms of resource availability, the costs of exploiting the resource may differ. An improved ability to assess costs and benefits is predicted to increase behavioural plasticity because it decreases the costs and increases the benefits of alternative behaviours. Moreover, because trade-offs change with age and plasticity is related to trade-offs, plasticity should also change with age. While the ability of animals to adjust to current trade-offs is fundamental for behavioural ecology, demonstration of ranges, slopes, and shapes of plastic behavioural responses is virtually absent from the literature. Knowledge concerning the ability of animals to adjust to environmental fluctuations is important for making predictions about population viability, but empirical evidence is greatly needed to validate current generalizations.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {The evolution of different parental care strategies is thought to result from variation in trade-offs between the costs and benefits associated with providing care. However, changing environmental conditions can alter such fitness trade-offs and favor plasticity in the type or amount of parental care provided. Avian incubation is a form of parental care where parents face changing environmental conditions, including variation in the risk of nest predation. Because parental activity can draw attention to the location of the nest, a reduction in nest visitation rates is a predicted response to an increased, immediate predation risk. Here, we experimentally increased the risk of nest predation using model presentations at nests of five coexisting species that differ in their ambient levels of nest predation. We examined whether individuals detect changes in nest predation risk and respond by reducing visitation to the nest. We also tested whether this behavioral response differs among species relative to differences in their ambient risk of nest predation. We found that males of all species detected the increased predation risk and reduced the rate at which they visited the nest to feed incubating females, and the magnitude of this change was highly correlated with differences in the risk of nest predation across species. Hence, as the vulnerability to nest predation increases, males appear more willing to trade the cost of reduced food delivery to the female against the benefit of reduced predation risk. Our results therefore suggest that nest predators can have differential effects on parental behaviors across species. We discuss how the comparative nature of our results can also provide insight into the evolution of behavioral plasticity.},

To the surprise of most physiologists, all empirical examinations of the {BAH} have rejected its generality.

In total, 35 macroinvertebrate species were found with Chironomidae the dominant taxonomic group. Macroinvertebrate density increased significantly with temperature. Dominant species in the warm streams were Lymnaea peregra and Simulium vittatum. Algal biomass, macrophyte cover and richness were unrelated to temperature. Densities of trout (Salmo trutta), the only fish species present, reflected habitat conditions and to a lesser degree temperature. 3. Density of filter-feeders increased significantly with temperature whereas scraper density, the other dominant functional feeding group, was unrelated to temperature. Stable isotope analysis revealed a positive relationship between δ15N and temperature across several trophic levels. No pattern was found with regard to δ13C and temperature. 4. Leaf litter decomposition in both fine and coarse mesh leaf bags were significantly correlated to temperature. In coarse mesh leaf packs breakdown rates were almost doubled compared with fine mesh, ranging between 0.5 and 1.3 g {DW} 28 days−1. Nutrient diffusion substrates showed that the streams were primarily nitrogen limited across the temperature gradient while a significant additional effect of phosphorous was found with increasing temperature. 5. Structural and functional attributes gave complementary information which all indicated a change with temperature similar to what is found in moderately polluted streams.

	abstract = {Environmental warming is predicted to rise dramatically over the next century, yet few studies have investigated its effects in natural, multi-species systems. We present data collated over an 8-year period from a catchment of geothermally heated streams in Iceland, which acts as a natural experiment on the effects of warming across different organisational levels and spatiotemporal scales. Body sizes and population biomasses of individual species responded strongly to temperature, with some providing evidence to support temperature–size rules. Macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal community composition also changed dramatically across the thermal gradient. Interactions within the warm streams in particular were characterised by food chains linking algae to snails to the apex predator, brown trout. These chains were missing from the colder systems, where snails were replaced by much smaller herbivores and invertebrate omnivores were the top predators. Trout were also subsidised by terrestrial invertebrate prey, which could have an effect analogous to apparent competition within the aquatic prey assemblage. Top-down effects by snails on diatoms were stronger in the warmer streams, which could account for a shallowing of mass–abundance slopes across the community. This may indicate reduced energy transfer efficiency from resources to consumers in the warmer systems and/or a change in predator–prey mass ratios. All the ecosystem process rates investigated increased with temperature, but with differing thermal sensitivities, with important implications for overall ecosystem functioning (e.g. creating potential imbalances in elemental fluxes). Ecosystem respiration rose rapidly with temperature, leading to increased heterotrophy. There were also indications that food web stability may be lower in the warmer streams.},

	abstract = {Whether the thermal sensitivity of an organism’s traits follows the simple Boltzmann-Arrhenius model remains a contentious issue that centers around consideration of its operational temperature range and whether the sensitivity corresponds to one or a few underlying rate-limiting enzymes. Resolving this issue is crucial, because mechanistic models for temperature dependence of traits are required to predict the biological effects of climate change. Here, by combining theory with data on 1,085 thermal responses from a wide range of traits and organisms, we show that substantial variation in thermal sensitivity (activation energy) estimates can arise simply because of variation in the range of measured temperatures. Furthermore, when thermal responses deviate systematically from the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model, variation in measured temperature ranges across studies can bias estimated activation energy distributions toward higher mean, median, variance, and skewness. Remarkably, this bias alone can yield activation energies that encompass the range expected from biochemical reactions (from ∼0.2 to 1.2 {eV}), making it difficult to establish whether a single activation energy appropriately captures thermal sensitivity. We provide guidelines and a simple equation for partially correcting for such artifacts. Our results have important implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of thermal responses of biological traits and for accurately modeling effects of variation in thermal sensitivity on responses of individuals, populations, and ecological communities to changing climatic temperatures.},

Uncertainty arises because the hypothesis focuses on the relative performance of organisms exposed to one environment versus another, whereas the raw material available to evolution is variation in acclimation responses of individual traits. This mismatch is problematic when organisms are exposed to poor environments. In poor environments, the adaptive or maladaptive value of changes in individual traits may be obscured by long-term decrements in organismal condition. A better match between the evolutionary pressures shaping acclimation and the tests used to examine them can be achieved by focusing on the fitness consequences of acclimation changes in individual traits.},

	abstract = {Aim

Climate change is currently altering the geographical distribution of species, but how this process contributes to biogeographical variation in ecological traits is unknown. Range-shifting species are predicted to encounter and respond to new selective regimes during their expansion phase, but also carry historical adaptations to their ancestral range. We sought to identify how historical and novel components of the environment interact to shape latitudinal trends in thermal tolerance, thermal tolerance breadth and phenotypic plasticity of a range-shifting species.


Location

Southern and central Sweden.


Methods

To evaluate phenotypic responses to changes in the thermal selective environment, we experimentally determined the upper and lower thermal tolerances of {\textgreater} 2000 wild-caught damselflies (Ischnura elegans) from populations distributed across core and expanding range-edge regions. We then identified changing correlations between thermal tolerance, climate and recent weather events across the range expansion. Niche modelling was employed to evaluate the relative contributions of varying climatic selective regimes to overall habitat suitability for the species in core versus range-edge regions.


Results

Upper thermal tolerance exhibited local adaptation to climate in the core region, but showed evidence of having been released from thermal selection during the current range expansion. In contrast, chill coma recovery exhibited local adaptation across the core region and range expansion, corresponding to increased climatic variability at higher latitudes. Adaptive plasticity of lower thermal tolerances (acclimation ability) increased towards the northern, expanding range edge.


Main conclusions

Our results suggest micro-evolutionary mechanisms for several large-scale and general biogeographical patterns, including spatially and latitudinally invariant heat tolerances (Brett's rule) and increased thermal acclimation rates and niche breadths at higher latitudes. Population-level processes unique to climate-mediated range expansions may commonly underpin many broader, macro-physiological trends.},

Lizards adapted to living in lowland tropical areas are especially vulnerable because of their dependence on specific microhabitats, low vagility, and a reduced capacity to physiologically adjust to environmental change. To assess the potential effects of climate change on lizards in the lowland tropics, we measured the critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}) of ten species from La Selva, Costa Rica. We also examined how well body size, microhabitat type, and species predicted the {CTmax}. We used current temperature data along with projected temperature increases for 2080 to predict which species may be at the greatest risk at La Selva. Of the ten species sampled, four are at serious risk of lowland extirpation and three others might also be at risk under the highest predicted temperature-increase models. Forest floor lizards at La Selva have already experienced significant population declines over the past 40 years, and we found that each of the forest floor species we studied is at serious risk of local extirpation. We also found that microhabitat type is the strongest predictor of {CTmax}, demonstrating the profound impact habitat specialization has on the thermal limits of tropical lizards.},

We tested the hypothesis that interspecific difference in the capacity for thermal acclimation modulates predator–prey interactions. Acclimation of locomotor performance in a predator (Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata) was qualitatively different to that of its prey (eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki). Warm (25C) acclimated bass made more attacks than cold (15C) acclimated fish regardless of acute test temperatures (10–30C), and greater frequency of attacks was associated with increased prey capture success. However, the number of attacks declined at the highest test temperature (30C). Interestingly, escape speeds of mosquitofish during predation trials were greater than burst speeds measured in a swimming arena, whereas attack speeds of bass were lower than burst speeds. As a result, escape speeds of mosquitofish were greater at warm temperatures (25C and 30C) than attack speeds of bass. The decline in the number of attacks and the increase in escape speed of prey means that predation pressure decreases at high temperatures. We show that differential thermal responses affect species interactions even at temperatures that are within thermal tolerance ranges. This thermal sensitivity of predator–prey interactions can be a mechanism by which global warming affects ecological communities.},

A major challenge for the next decade will be to evaluate the combined effects of these multiple stressors on organisms and ecosystems. For organisms submitted to chemical, biological or physical stressors, the capacity to set up an efficient adaptive response is a fundamental prerequisite for their long-term survival and performance. In this study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were subjected to individual and combined pesticide mixtures and increased temperatures to evaluate their adaptive response in multistress conditions from the molecular to the individual level. Fish were exposed for 16 days to a mixture of pesticides at environmental relevant concentrations (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin and tebuconazole) and at two temperatures (22 degrees C and 32 degrees C). Three major physiological traits of the stress response were measured: the hormonal response (i.e. plasma cortisol), the metabolic balance from molecular to individuals' levels (metabolomics, cellular energy allocation, energy reserves and global condition indexes), and the cellular defense system induction ({SOD}, {CAT} and {GST}). Results show that (1) environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides lead to significant responses in fish at all biological levels; (2) the metabolic response depends on the nature of stress (thermal vs. chemical); and (3) fish may be unable to set up an efficient adaptive response when chemical and thermal stresses were combined, with adverse outcomes at the individuals' level.

Controversy surrounds the model's implication of a mechanistic basis for metabolism that excludes the effects of adaptive regulation, and it is unclear how this would apply to organisms that live in fringe environments and typically show considerable metabolic adaptation. We explored thermal scaling of metabolism in a rocky-shore eulittoral-fringe snail (Echinolittorina malaccana) that experiences constrained energy gain and fluctuating high temperatures (between 25°C and approximately 50°C) during prolonged emersion (weeks). In contrast to the prediction of the {UTD} model, metabolic rate was often negatively related to temperature over a benign range (30–40°C), the relationship depending on (i) the temperature range, (ii) the degree of metabolic depression (related to the quiescent period), and (iii) whether snails were isolated within their shells. Apparent activation energies (E) varied between 0.05 and −0.43 {eV}, deviating excessively from the {UTD}'s predicted range of between 0.6 and 0.7 {eV}. The lowering of metabolism when heated should improve energy conservation in a high-temperature environment and challenges both the theory's generality and its mechanistic basis.},

Trials were conducted at 20, 22, 25, 30, 32 and 35C under controlled conditions. Trials lasted 14 days, during which, lizards were fed ca. 1 g meal-worms per day.

Appetite was significantly different between the different temperatures measured. The decrease of gut passage time with increasing temperature was expected, since the digestive and assimilation efficiencies are similar over the range of temperatures tested.

Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer–resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer–resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.},

	abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important environmental parameters influencing all the biological processes and functions of poikilothermic organisms. Although extensive research has been carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature on animal life histories and to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds as well as the optimal temperatures for survival, development, and reproduction, few studies have investigated links between thermal window, metabolism, and trophic interactions such as predation. We developed models and conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how temperature influences predator–prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional response) using a ladybeetle larva feeding on aphid prey. As predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology, we found that handling time exponentially decreases with warming, but—in contrast with this theory—search rate follows a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. An examination of the model reveals that temperature thresholds for predation depend mainly on search rate, suggesting that predation rate is primarily determined by searching activities and secondly by prey handling. In contrast with prior studies, our model shows that per capita short-term predator–prey interaction strengths and predator energetic efficiency (per capita feeding rate relative to metabolism) generally increase with temperature, reach an optimum, and then decrease at higher temperatures. We conclude that integrating the concept of thermal windows in short- and long-term ecological studies would lead to a better understanding of predator–prey population dynamics at thermal limits and allow better predictions of global warming effects on natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Comparative analyses of avian energetics often involve the implicit assumption that basal metabolic rate ({BMR}) is a fixed, taxon-specific trait. However, in most species that have been investigated, {BMR} exhibits phenotypic flexibility and can be reversibly adjusted over short time scales. Many non-migrants adjust {BMR} seasonally, with the winter {BMR} usually higher than the summer {BMR}. The data that are currently available do not, however, support the idea that the magnitude and direction of these adjustments varies consistently with body mass. Long-distance migrants often exhibit large intra-annual changes in {BMR}, reflecting the physiological adjustments associated with different stages of their migratory cycles. Phenotypic flexibility in {BMR} also represents an important component of short-term thermal acclimation under laboratory conditions, with captive birds increasing {BMR} when acclimated to low air temperatures and vice versa. The emerging view of avian {BMR} is of a highly flexible physiological trait that is continually adjusted in response to environmental factors such as temperature. The within-individual variation observed in avian {BMR} demands a critical re-examination of approaches used for comparisons across taxa. Several key questions concerning the shapes and other properties of avian {BMR} reaction norms urgently need to be addressed, and hypotheses concerning metabolic adaptation should explicitly account for phenotypic flexibility.},

	abstract = {Warming could strongly stabilize or destabilize populations and food webs by changing the interaction strengths between predators and their prey. Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interaction strengths in the short and long term. Additionally, we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation. Together, these results suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects on predator–prey interactions and food-web stability.},

Very high correlations of parameter estimators occassionally make regression with their equation impossible using Marquardt's algorithm (1963). This analysis describes a new formulation of Sharpe and {DeMichele}'s model that greatly alleviates the non-linear regression problem. It is partly based on Hultin's formulation (1955). Biological and graphical interpretation of the model parameters is discussed. Regression suitability is illustrated with a typical data set.

	abstract = {For at least 200 years, since the time of Malthus, population growth has been recognized as providing a critical link between the performance of individual organisms and the ecology and evolution of species. We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth,  , and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population‐level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual‐level and population‐level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why   exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, fishes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for  . The metabolic flux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates. Data for marine fishes in the field support these predictions for instantaneous rates of mortality. This theory links the rates of metabolism and resource use of individuals to life‐history attributes and population dynamics for a broad assortment of organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic acclimation is generally assumed to confer an advantage in the environment that stimulates the response. To test this beneficial acclimation assumption explicitly, we investigated the consequences of temperature acclimation for the fitness of Escherichia coli at two temperatures, 32 degrees C and 41.5 degrees C. Both temperatures permit growth and long-term persistence of the genotypes in serial culture. We found that prior acclimation to 32 degrees C, relative to acclimation to 41.5 degrees C, enhanced fitness at 32 degrees C, consistent with the assumption. But prior acclimation to 41.5 degrees C actually reduced fitness at 41.5 degrees C, relative to acclimation to 32 degrees C. Hence, the assumption that acclimation always confers an advantage is demonstrated to be false. Acclimation to 41.5 degrees C did, however, improve survival at 50 degrees C, a lethal temperature. This protective response has been shown to be associated with the induction of stress proteins. The reduced competitive fitness caused by acclimation at 41.5 degrees C may reflect a physiological burden associated with expression of stress proteins when they are not needed to prevent lethal damage. Whatever the cause, acclimation to the higher temperature decreased competitive fitness at that temperature.},
