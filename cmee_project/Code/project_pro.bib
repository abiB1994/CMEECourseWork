	abstract = {The {ImageNet} Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in object category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories and millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5 years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements.},

	abstract = {Agricultural productivity is something on which economy highly depends. This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. For instance a disease named little leaf disease is a hazardous disease found in pine trees in United States. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves. This paper presents an algorithm for image segmentation technique which is used for automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. It also covers survey on different diseases classification techniques that can be used for plant leaf disease detection. Image segmentation, which is an important aspect for disease detection in plant leaf disease, is done by using genetic algorithm.},

The global epidemic of coffee leaf rust, caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix, illustrates the ecological and economic impact of such exchanges. Between 1865 and 1985, the epidemic spread from its original focus in Ceylon to engulf all of the world's coffee zones. Its economic impact varied considerably: in some places it destroyed more than 90\% of the coffee crop, while in others it was little more than a minor irritant. The epidemic's origins, its diffusion, and its impacts were not accidental, but reflected specific conjunctures of local and global biological and historical processes.},

	abstract = {The improvement and application of pest and disease models to analyse and predict yield losses including those due to climate change is still a challenge for the scientific community. Applied modelling of crop diseases and pests has mostly targeted the development of support capabilities to schedule scouting or pesticide applications. There is a need for research to both broaden the scope and evaluate the capabilities of pest and disease models. Key research questions not only involve the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on known pathosystems, but also on new pathogens which could alter the (still incompletely documented) impacts of pests and diseases on agricultural systems. Yield loss data collected in various current environments may no longer represent a adequate reference to develop tactical, decision-oriented, models for plant diseases and pests and their impacts, because of the ongoing changes in climate patterns. Process-based agricultural simulation modelling, on the other hand, appears to represent a viable methodology to estimate the impacts of these potential effects. A new generation of tools based on state-of-the-art knowledge and technologies is needed to allow systems analysis including key processes and their dynamics over appropriate suitable range of environmental variables. This paper offers a brief overview of the current state of development in coupling pest and disease models to crop models, and discusses technical and scientific challenges. We propose a five-stage roadmap to improve the simulation of the impacts caused by plant diseases and pests; i) improve the quality and availability of data for model inputs; ii) improve the quality and availability of data for model evaluation; iii) improve the integration with crop models; iv) improve the processes for model evaluation; and v) develop a community of plant pest and disease modelers.},

Recently, Piriformospora indica, a plant-root-colonizing basidiomycete fungus, has been discovered in the Indian Thar desert and was shown to provide strong growth-promoting activity during its symbiosis with a broad spectrum of plants [Verma, S. et al. (1998) Mycologia 90, 896-903]. Here, we report on the potential of P. indica to induce resistance to fungal diseases and tolerance to salt stress in the monocotyledonous plant barley. The beneficial effect on the defense status is detected in distal leaves, demonstrating a systemic induction of resistance by a root-endophytic fungus. The systemically altered ``defense readines'' is associated with an elevated antioxidative capacity due to an activation of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle and results in an overall increase in grain yield. Because P. indica can be easily propagated in the absence of a host plant, we conclude that the fungus could be exploited to increase disease resistance and yield in crop plants.},

In addition to the failure of the plant immune system, there are other host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility.

	abstract = {Summary
Phytopathogens can manipulate plant hormone signaling to access nutrients and counteract defense responses. Pseudomonas syringae produces coronatine, a toxin that mimics the plant hormone jasmonic acid isoleucine and promotes opening of stomata for bacterial entry, bacterial growth in the apoplast, systemic susceptibility, and disease symptoms. We examined the mechanisms underlying coronatine-mediated virulence and show that coronatine activates three homologous {NAC} transcription factor ({TF}) genes, {ANAC}019, {ANAC}055, and {ANAC}072, through direct activity of the {TF}, {MYC}2. Genetic characterization of {NAC} {TF} mutants demonstrates that these {TFs} mediate coronatine-induced stomatal reopening and bacterial propagation in both local and systemic tissues by inhibiting the accumulation of the key plant immune signal salicylic acid ({SA}). These {NAC} {TFs} exert this inhibitory effect by repressing {ICS}1 and activating {BSMT}1, genes involved in {SA} biosynthesis and metabolism, respectively. Thus, a signaling cascade by which coronatine confers its multiple virulence activities has been elucidated.},

Recognition of microbes occurs by common conserved structures called microbe-associated molecular patterns ({MAMPs}). Plant pathogens and beneficial soil-borne microbes live in close contact with their host. Hence, prevention of the host’s defence programme is essential for their survival. Active suppression of host defences by microbial effector proteins is a well-known strategy employed by many successful plant-associated microbes. Evasion of host immune recognition is less well studied but is emerging as another important strategy. Escape from recognition by the host’s immune system can be caused by alterations in the structure of the recognized {MAMPs}, or by active intervention of ligand-receptor recognition. This paper reviews the structure and recognition of common {MAMPs} and the ways that plant-associated microbes have evolved to prevent detection by their host.},

The new technologies are enabling the identification of key gene activity responses to the range of biotic and abiotic challenges experienced by plants. In the past, plant breeders produced new varieties with changes in the phases of development, modifications of plant architecture and improved levels of tolerance and resistance to environmental and biotic challenges by identifying the required phenotypes in a few plants among the large numbers of plants in a breeding population. Now our increased knowledge and powerful gene sequence-based diagnostics provide plant breeders with more precise selection objectives and assays to operate in rationally planned crop improvement programmes. We can expect yield potential to increase and harvested product quality portfolios to better fit an increasing diversity of market requirements. The new genetics will connect agriculture to sectors beyond the food, feed and fibre industries; agri-business will contribute to public health and will provide high-value products to the pharmaceutical industry as well as to industries previously based on petroleum feedstocks and chemical modification processes.},

The proposed modification has the desirable characteristic of being invariant with respect to photometric distortions. Since the resulting similarity measure is a nonlinear function of the warp parameters, we develop two iterative schemes for its maximization, one based on the forward additive approach and the second on the inverse compositional method. As it is customary in iterative optimization, in each iteration, the nonlinear objective function is approximated by an alternative expression for which the corresponding optimization is simple. In our case we propose an efficient approximation that leads to a closed-form solution (per iteration) which is of low computational complexity, the latter property being particularly strong in our inverse version. The proposed schemes are tested against the Forward Additive Lucas-Kanade and the Simultaneous Inverse Compositional ({SIC}) algorithm through simulations. Under noisy conditions and photometric distortions, our forward version achieves more accurate alignments and exhibits faster convergence whereas our inverse version has similar performance as the {SIC} algorithm but at a lower computational complexity.},

	abstract = {Background The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch ({HK}) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this ‘illusion’ to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use {fMRI} brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related {fMRI} studies.  Results Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the {HK} effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with {fMRI}.  Conclusions The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond.},

	abstract = {Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents. However, there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple ``do-it-yourself'' implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure- dependent learning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop, or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis. We illustrate our claims on the {MNIST} set of English digit images.},

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep {CNN} training.

	abstract = {Spatially continuous predictions of seabed hardness are important baseline environmental information for sustainable management of Australia’s marine jurisdiction. Seabed hardness is often inferred from multibeam backscatter data with unknown accuracy and can be inferred from underwater video footage at limited locations. In this study, we classified the seabed into four classes based on two new seabed hardness classification schemes (i.e., hard90 and hard70). We developed optimal predictive models to predict seabed hardness using random forest ({RF}) based on the point data of hardness classes and spatially continuous multibeam data. Five feature selection ({FS}) methods that are variable importance ({VI}), averaged variable importance ({AVI}), knowledge informed {AVI} ({KIAVI}), Boruta and regularized {RF} ({RRF}) were tested based on predictive accuracy. Effects of highly correlated, important and unimportant predictors on the accuracy of {RF} predictive models were examined. Finally, spatial predictions generated using the most accurate models were visually examined and analysed. This study confirmed that: 1) hard90 and hard70 are effective seabed hardness classification schemes; 2) seabed hardness of four classes can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy; 3) the typical approach used to pre-select predictive variables by excluding highly correlated variables needs to be re-examined; 4) the identification of the important and unimportant predictors provides useful guidelines for further improving predictive models; 5) {FS} methods select the most accurate predictive model(s) instead of the most parsimonious ones, and {AVI} and Boruta are recommended for future studies; and 6) {RF} is an effective modelling method with high predictive accuracy for multi-level categorical data and can be applied to ‘small p and large n’ problems in environmental sciences. Additionally, automated computational programs for {AVI} need to be developed to increase its computational efficiency and caution should be taken when applying filter {FS} methods in selecting predictive models.},

	abstract = {Power generation from distributed solar photovoltaic {PV} arrays has grown rapidly in recent years. As a result, there is interest in collecting information about the quantity, power capacity, and energy generated by such arrays; and to do so over small geo-spatial regions (e.g., counties, cities, or even smaller regions). Unfortunately, existing sources of such information are dispersed, limited in geospatial resolution, and otherwise incomplete or publically unavailable. As result, we recently proposed a new approach for collecting such distributed {PV} information that relies on computer algorithms to automatically detect {PV} arrays in high resolution aerial imagery [1], Here we build on this work by investigating two machine learning algorithms for {PV} array detection: a Random Forest classifier ({RF}) [2] and a deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}) [3]. We use the {RF} algorithm as a benchmark, or baseline, for comparison with a {CNN} model. The two models are developed and tested using a large collection of publicly available [4] aerial imagery, covering 135 km2, and including over 2,700 manually annotated distributed {PV} array locations. The results indicate that the {CNN} substantially improves over the {RF}. The {CNN} is capable of excellent performance, detecting nearly 80\% of true panels with a precision measure of 72\%.},

Fingerprints are grouped into disjoint classes, so that an input fingerprint is compared only with those belonging to the predicted class, reducing the penetration rate of the search. The classification procedure usually starts by the extraction of features from the fingerprint image, frequently based on visual characteristics. In this work, we propose an approach to fingerprint classification using convolutional neural networks, which avoid the necessity of an explicit feature extraction process by incorporating the image processing within the training of the classifier. Furthermore, such an approach is able to predict a class even for low-quality fingerprints that are rejected by commonly used algorithms, such as {FingerCode}. The study gives special importance to the robustness of the classification for different impressions of the same fingerprint, aiming to minimize the penetration in the database. In our experiments, convolutional neural networks yielded better accuracy and penetration rate than state-of-the-art classifiers based on explicit feature extraction. The tested networks also improved on the runtime, as a result of the joint optimization of both feature extraction and classification.},

We introduce a technique which will diagnose and classify external disease within fruits. Traditional system uses thousands of words which lead to boundary of language. Whereas system that we have come up with, uses image processing techniques for implementation as image is easy way for conveying. In the proposed work, {OpenCV} library is applied for implementation. K-means clustering method is applied for image segmentation, the images are catalogue and mapped to their respective disease categories on basis of four feature vectors color, morphology, texture and structure of hole on the fruit. The system uses two image databases, one for implementation of query images and the other for training of already stored disease images.

	abstract = {With big data growth in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care, and community services. However, the analysis accuracy is reduced when the quality of medical data is incomplete. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique characteristics of certain regional diseases, which may weaken the prediction of disease outbreaks. In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network ({CNN})-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics. Compared with several typical prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8\% with a convergence speed, which is faster than that of the {CNN}-based unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm.},

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35\% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path towards smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.},

	abstract = {In recent years, vector-based machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, support vector machines, and 1-D convolutional neural networks, have shown promising results in hyperspectral image classification. Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to information loss in representing hyperspectral pixels, which intrinsically have a sequence-based data structure. A recurrent neural network ({RNN}), an important branch of the deep learning family, is mainly designed to handle sequential data. Can sequence-based {RNN} be an effective method of hyperspectral image classification? In this paper, we propose a novel {RNN} model that can effectively analyze hyperspectral pixels as sequential data and then determine information categories via network reasoning. As far as we know, this is the first time that an {RNN} framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, our {RNN} makes use of a newly proposed activation function, parametric rectified tanh ({PRetanh}), for hyperspectral sequential data analysis instead of the popular tanh or rectified linear unit. The proposed activation function makes it possible to use fairly high learning rates without the risk of divergence during the training procedure. Moreover, a modified gated recurrent unit, which uses {PRetanh} for hidden representation, is adopted to construct the recurrent layer in our network to efficiently process hyperspectral data and reduce the total number of parameters. Experimental results on three airborne hyperspectral images suggest competitive performance in the proposed mode. In addition, the proposed network architecture opens a new window for future research, showcasing the huge potential of deep recurrent networks for hyperspectral data analysis.},

In this study, we examined and compared the performances of the {RF}, {kNN}, and {SVM} classifiers for land use/cover classification using Sentinel-2 image data. An area of 30 × 30 km² within the Red River Delta of Vietnam with six land use/cover types was classified using 14 different training sample sizes, including balanced and imbalanced, from 50 to over 1250 pixels/class. All classification results showed a high overall accuracy ({OA}) ranging from 90\% to 95\%. Among the three classifiers and 14 sub-datasets, {SVM} produced the highest {OA} with the least sensitivity to the training sample sizes, followed consecutively by {RF} and {kNN}. In relation to the sample size, all three classifiers showed a similar and high {OA} (over 93.85\%) when the training sample size was large enough, i.e., greater than 750 pixels/class or representing an area of approximately 0.25\% of the total study area. The high accuracy was achieved with both imbalanced and balanced datasets.},

Surprisingly, the co-occurrence of different stresses is rarely addressed by molecular biologists that study plant acclimation. Recent studies have revealed that the response of plants to a combination of two different abiotic stresses is unique and cannot be directly extrapolated from the response of plants to each of the different stresses applied individually. Tolerance to a combination of different stress conditions, particularly those that mimic the field environment, should be the focus of future research programs aimed at developing transgenic crops and plants with enhanced tolerance to naturally occurring environmental conditions.},

Using a fundamental concept that patterns from a single-object class lie on a linear subspace, we develop a linear model representing a probe image as a linear combination of class-specific galleries. The inverse problem is solved using the least-squares method and the decision is ruled in favor of the class with the minimum reconstruction error. The proposed Linear Regression Classification ({LRC}) algorithm falls in the category of nearest subspace classification. The algorithm is extensively evaluated on several standard databases under a number of exemplary evaluation protocols reported in the face recognition literature. A comparative study with state-of-the-art algorithms clearly reflects the efficacy of the proposed approach. For the problem of contiguous occlusion, we propose a Modular {LRC} approach, introducing a novel Distance-based Evidence Fusion ({DEF}) algorithm. The proposed methodology achieves the best results ever reported for the challenging problem of scarf occlusion.},

The measurements of disease severity for chosen dates after inoculation were compared to temperature distributions on infected leaves and to averaged reflectance characteristics. Statistical analysis revealed that leaf temperature distributions on particular days after inoculation and respective spectral characteristics, especially in the {SWIR} range (1000-2500 nm), significantly differed for the leaves inoculated with A. dauci from the other species of Alternaria as well as from leaves of non-treated plants. The significant differences in leaf temperature of the studied Alternaria species were observed in various stages of infection development. The classification experiments were performed on the hyperspectral data of the leaf surfaces to distinguish days after inoculation and Alternaria species. The second-derivative transformation of the spectral data together with back-propagation neural networks ({BNNs}) appeared to be the best combination for classification of days after inoculation (prediction accuracy 90.5\%) and Alternaria species (prediction accuracy 80.5\%).},

	abstract = {Most applications of hyperspectral imagery require processing techniques which achieve two fundamental goals: 1) detect and classify the constituent materials for each pixel in the scene; 2) reduce the data volume/dimensionality, without loss of critical information, so that it can be processed efficiently and assimilated by a human analyst. The authors describe a technique which simultaneously reduces the data dimensionality, suppresses undesired or interfering spectral signatures, and detects the presence of a spectral signature of interest. The basic concept is to project each pixel vector onto a subspace which is orthogonal to the undesired signatures. This operation is an optimal interference suppression process in the least squares sense. Once the interfering signatures have been nulled, projecting the residual onto the signature of interest maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio and results in a single component image that represents a classification for the signature of interest. The orthogonal subspace projection ({OSP}) operator can be extended to k-signatures of interest, thus reducing the dimensionality of k and classifying the hyperspectral image simultaneously. The approach is applicable to both spectrally pure as well as mixed pixels},

Measurements were performed over a period of 19 days, starting 1 week after crop emergence (early weeding can increase yields) and seven different weeds species were considered. The selection of the best filter combination was based on a quadratic discriminant analysis. The best combination of filters included three interference filters, respectively centred on 450, 550 and 700nm. With this combination, the overall classification accuracy ({CA}) was 72\%. When using only two filters, a slight degradation of the {CA} was noticed. When the classification results were reported on field images, a systematic misclassification of carrot cotyledons appears. Better results were obtained with a more advanced growth stage.},

	abstract = {Methods: We used autonomously ﬂying quadrocopters, supplied with either a panchromatic or colour infrared calibrated small frame digital camera to generate high resolution images of the restored bog surface. We performed a two-step classiﬁcation process of automatic image segmentation and object-based classiﬁcation to distinguish between four pre-deﬁned classes (waterlogged bare peat, Sphagnum spp., Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula pubescens. An independent validation procedure was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the classiﬁcation.
Results: A set-up composed of decision rules for reﬂectance, geometry and textural features was applied for identiﬁcation of the four classes. The presented classiﬁcation revealed an overall accuracy level of 91\%. Most reliable attribution was obtained for waterlogged bare peat and Sphagnum-covered surfaces, revealing producer accuracies of 95\% and 91\%, respectively. Lower but still feasible accuracy levels were obtained for Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula pubescens individuals (89\% and 84\%, respectively).
Conclusions: {UAV}-based {NIR} remote sensing is a promising tool for monitoring the restoration of cut-over bogs and has the potential to signiﬁcantly reduce laborious ﬁeld surveys. {UAVs} may increasingly play a signiﬁcant role in future ecological monitoring studies, since they are small in size, highly ﬂexible, easy to handle, non-emissive and available at a comparatively low cost.},

	abstract = {In nature, plants encounter a combination of environmental conditions that may include stresses such as drought or heat shock. Although drought and heat shock have been extensively studied, little is known about how their combination affect plants. We used {cDNA} arrays, coupled with physiological measurements, to study the effect of drought and heat shock on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. A combination of drought and heat shock resulted in the closure of stomata, suppression of photosynthesis, enhancement of respiration, and increased leaf temperature. Some transcripts induced during drought, e.g. those encoding dehydrin, catalase, and glycolate oxidase, and some transcripts induced during heat shock, e.g. thioredoxin peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase, were suppressed during a combination of drought and heat shock. In contrast, the expression of other transcripts, including alternative oxidase, glutathione peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, pathogenesis-related proteins, a {WRKY} transcription factor, and an ethylene response transcriptional co-activator, was specifically induced during a combination of drought and heat shock. Photosynthetic genes were suppressed, whereas transcripts encoding some glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes were induced, suggesting the utilization of sugars through these pathways during stress. Our results demonstrate that the response of plants to a combination of drought and heat shock, similar to the conditions in many natural environments, is different from the response of plants to each of these stresses applied individually, as typically tested in the laboratory. This response was also different from the response of plants to other stresses such as cold, salt, or pathogen attack. Therefore, improving stress tolerance of plants and crops may require a reevaluation, taking into account the effect of multiple stresses on plant metabolism and defense.},

In general, drought conditions influenced biomass production in most progenies, causing significant reductions in total leaf area, leaf number, leaf biomass, fine-roots length (diameter 1 mm), root volume and root area for considered drought intolerant. All progenies showed alterations in growth due to drought. Phenotypic plasticity was most strongly pronounced in root volume. Stem and root diameters, as well as stem dry biomass were the growth variables with the greatest direct effects on root volume under drought conditions, these characters being indicated in screening of cacao progenies drought tolerant.},

The classification was performed with respect to nitrogen application rates and weed management practices, and the classification accuracy was compared with those obtained by an artificial neural network ({ANN}) model on the same data. The field experiment consisted of three nitrogen application rates and four weed management strategies. A hyperspectral image was obtained with a 72-waveband Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager, at an early growth stage during the year 2000 growing season. Nitrogen application rates were 60, 120, and 250kgN/ha. Weed controls were: none, control of grasses, control of broadleaf weeds, and full weed control. Classification accuracy was evaluated for three cases: combinations of nitrogen application rates and weed infestation levels, nitrogen application rates alone, and weed controls alone. The {SVM} method resulted in very low misclassification rates, as compared to the {ANN} approach for all the three cases. Detection of stresses in early crop growth stage using the {SVM} method could aid in effective early application of site-specific remedies to timely in-season interventions.},

	abstract = {An experiment was conducted under outdoor pot-culture conditions to determine effects of nitrogen (N) deficiency on sorghum growth, physiology, and leaf hyperspectral reflectance properties. Sorghum (cv. {DK} 44C) was seeded in 360 twelve-litre pots filled with fine sand. All pots were irrigated with half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution from emergence to 25 days after sowing ({DAS}). Thereafter, pots were separated into three identical groups and the following treatments were initiated: (1) the control (100\% N) continued receiving the half-strength nutrient solution; (2) reduced N to 20\% of the control (20\% N); and (3) withheld N from the solution (0\% N). Photosynthetic rate (Pn), chlorophyll (Chl) and N concentrations, and hyperspectral reflectance of the uppermost, fully expanded leaves were determined at 3- to 4-day-interval from 21 to 58 {DAS} during the N treatments. Plants were harvested 58 {DAS} to determine effects of N deficiency on leaf area ({LA}), biomass accumulation, and partitioning. Nitrogen deficiency significantly reduced {LA}, leaf Chl content and Pn, resulting in lower biomass production. Decreased leaf Pn due to N deficiency was mainly associated with lower stomatal conductance rather than carboxylation capacity of leaf chemistry. Among plant components of dry weights, leaf dry weight had the greatest and root dry weight had the smallest decrease under N deficiency. Nitrogen-deficit stress mainly increased leaf reflectance at 555 (R555) and 715 nm (R715) and caused a red-edge shift to shorter wavelength. },

It also alters the seed germination and growth of plants. In this study, we investigated the effects of {SV} on the resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana against Botrytis cinerea infection. The microarray analysis was performed on infected Arabidopsis plants pre-exposed to {SV} of 1000 Hertz with 100 decibels. Broadly, the transcriptomic analysis revealed up-regulation of several defense and {SA}-responsive and/or signaling genes. Quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) analysis of selected genes also validated the induction of {SA}-mediated response in the infected Arabidopsis plants pre-exposed to {SV}. Corroboratively, hormonal analysis identified the increased concentration of salicylic acid ({SA}) in the {SV}-treated plants after pathogen inoculation. In contrast, jasmonic acid ({JA}) level in the {SV}-treated plants remained stable but lower than control plants during the infection. Based on these findings, we propose that {SV} treatment invigorates the plant defense system by regulating the {SA}-mediated priming effect, consequently promoting the {SV}-induced resistance in Arabidopsis against B. cinerea.},

To investigate the contributions of these compounds in resistance of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, three types of experiments were conducted: (a) quantitative disease assays with plants pretreated with ethylene, inhibitors of ethylene perception, or salicylate; (b) quantitative disease assays with mutants or transgenes affected in the production of or the response to either ethylene or jasmonate; and (c) expression analysis of defense-related genes before and after inoculation of plants with B. cinerea. Plants pretreated with ethylene showed a decreased susceptibility toward B. cinerea, whereas pretreatment with 1-methylcyclopropene, an inhibitor of ethylene perception, resulted in increased susceptibility. Ethylene pretreatment induced expression of several pathogenesis-related protein genes before B. cinerea infection. Proteinase inhibitor I expression was repressed by ethylene and induced by 1-methylcyclopropene. Ethylene also induced resistance in the {mutantNever} ripe. {RNA} analysis showed that Never ripe retained some ethylene sensitivity. The {mutantEpinastic}, constitutively activated in a subset of ethylene responses, and a transgenic line producing negligible ethylene were also tested. The results confirmed that ethylene responses are important for resistance of tomato to B. cinerea. The mutant Defenseless, impaired in jasmonate biosynthesis, showed increased susceptibility to B. cinerea. A transgenic line with reduced prosystemin expression showed similar susceptibility as Defenseless, whereas a prosystemin-overexpressing transgene was highly resistant. Ethylene and wound signaling acted independently on resistance. Salicylate and ethylene acted synergistically on defense gene expression, but antagonistically on resistance.},
