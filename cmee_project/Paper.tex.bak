\begin{abstract}
      Determining the incidence and types of plant stresses has been of interest for many years, particularly
    due to their negative impact on agricultural production. Despite this, current methods
    are very qualitative, with many relying on manual detection which can be highly variable.
    With this in mind, our aim for this project was to see whether we could use machine learning techniques, in particular Random Forests (RFs) and Convoltional Neural Networks (CNNs),
    to classify complex plant stresses from RGB and colour-pass filtered leaf images. Two plant leaf datasets were collected; an infection duration study conducted to assess the impact of \textit{Botrytis cinerea} on \textit{Arabadopsis thaliana} over a 72 hour period, and a complex multi-stress study, involving drought, nitrogen deficiency and \textit{Botrytis cinerea}, conducted on tomato leaves. We found strong support that machine learning  can correctly identify both infection duration and complex/multi stresses in an image; both Rfs and CNNs produced training accuracies of \textgreater 85\%. Finally, it was noted that the use of colour-pass filters improve model performance. Overall the results obtained from this study will be greatly benefical to both the botantical and horticultural communities, and to the future of crop production.
