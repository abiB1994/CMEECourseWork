#Population structure

CLosely related orgs capable of mating
pops evo.
pop genetics - allele freqs. everything derives from all.freq.diffs.

Mutations:
SNP - Single Nucleotide POlymorph.
Recomb-

Hardy - Weinberg

Allele freq - can get some genotype freqs if no evo.
Cond. necessary:
-pop infinite
-no mut
-no gene flow
-random mate

Some pops closer than others

Panmixia:
-Random mating
-Outbred(expected hetero. is what you observe)
-Genetically homozygous

Demes:
-More likely to mate with others in deme
-Inbred
-Mating non random

F-statistics - Give us the observed heterozygosity relative to what you
expect in idealised conditions (HW)

Fst (Inbreeding coef. Subpop relative to total Pop)

Fst = 1 - [obs(Aa)/ Exp(Aa)]		*Aa = Heterozygotes
									* Exp(Aa) = 2pq (HW)

Fit = Inbreeding coef. individual relative to total pop
Fis = "									" to subpop


Structure approach:

-Non - heir. clust. method
-only gen. data
-Assumes K subpops instant. split- run with various k's to see which values fit data best
-Attempts to maxim. HW and linkage equil.(associations between alleles)
-Utilises allele freq. diff and corr between alleles to id. groups and group memb.
-Assigns each indiv. a prop of ancestry 

Demographic History:

Fixation of Neutral Mutations:

-For an locus , 2Nu mutat. nters a pop each gen
-Each new mut has a prob of being fixed equal to its intitial freq 1/(2n)
2nu * 1/(2n) = u Av. no. of subs. per locus per gen

For all pops no matter what the size, mut rate is the same, but fixation time differs
