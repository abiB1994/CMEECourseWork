# Genomics - Day 1

Understand how genomic data prod.
sources of avail. data
sources of DNA
types of Qs to address
Common analytical methods

Human Genome Project

Why?

Pop genetics -

Functional Genomics -

Behavioural Genetics - Hybrid zones and diff behaviours 

Single locus vs genomic data - mono- para - poly phyly 
The tree that you get at any 1 locus is quite random! Need more than
1 point to decide on a tree

De novo - sequencing a species that we haven't seq. before
vs
re-seq - seq what we already know, easier to reconstruct

Polymorphisms - Looking for heterozygous positions - sites that
change in individuals

RAD- seq - Restriction site Associated DNA seq - Shrinks genome into
managable size -  Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP discovery method)
Where populations vary - Cannot discover NEW var with SNP, only look at 
already know var. sites

RNA - Seq
