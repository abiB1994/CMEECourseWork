# Natural Selection

Linkage Equil + disequil 
-LD is correlation between polymorphisms

# Phylogenetics

Relationships between time:
-Trait evolution - Evolution of Guenons :old world monkeys - all look 
really diff but closely related. Live sympatrically. All are capable of 
hybridising, so dist. diff looks maybe neccessary to prevent inbreeding

Phylogenetic Pseudoreplication:
- Sudorep. things that are linked but you act like they arent 
Closer phylogeny - more closely linked, share more genetics

Trying to unite groups that are most closely related - also helps if
you have a knowledge of time when species diverged, can then put a time 
on things

Few fixed diff. occur between human pops - Afr vs Eur vs Asi

Evolution occurs at different rates in different lineages/species etc
-Some species have their niche "perfected"
-Generation time
-Mutation rate

Rate of evo product of gen time and mutation rate

Incomplete lineage sorting - 
-If you only sample 1 locus, you will get a completely diff picture - discordance
amount of discordance depends on actual pop history +
Effective pop size of ancestral descendant 

Discordance between gene trees and sp. trees. Don't show same branching pattern

Fossils only give us part of the story - min. time that a split could have occured
Fossils always younger than divergence date, allelic lin. diverg. always older
